Informed Consent Overview

Consent for participation in research requires an informed consent process. This process involves an information exchange and on-going communication that takes place between the investigator (researcher) and the potential research participant (subject).

This research experiment relates to testing how memorization is affected by motion, specifically within a virtual environment (or a video game). To fulfill this you will be tested on a random subject matter, in this case, the religion of Islam. Through your potential participation I will facilitate a learning process within this virtual environment, in which you will engage in a number of brief practice quizzes. Your scores and time for each quiz will be recorded. Your screen will also be recorded as you engage in the study for the purposes of data integrity. Any data gathered through your participation will be anonymous along with any personal information you may submit, including your gender, age, visual acuity, religious background, major, prior experience with virtual environments, and weekly use of applications that contain virtual environments. 

At any point after signing the consent form, should you choose, you can end your participation in this experiment. Otherwise, your participation will conclude when the experiment is completed. In either case, you will be debriefed about the study via a discussion about the software and the aim of the experiment, and allowed to ask any clarifying questions about the research.

Before giving you the consent form, I will entertain any discussion relating to the research and the experiment, and disclose any information should you have a question about it. Should you have any further questions about this research that would not affect your performance in the study, I will answer them.
