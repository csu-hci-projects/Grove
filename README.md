### Project Introduction:

I am Luke Grove and this is my research project for CS-464.

For a visual demonstration of how the project work, please view the YouTube video linked above. In short, this prototype allows an individual to control a player character within a virtual environment, manipulating physics objects to answer questions. It is being designed in Unity and Visual Studio Code, with relevant code being pushed to this GitHub repository. The related experiment to this prototype relates to testing how movement effects memory through the facilitation of a number of practice quizzes on a neutral subject matter, ideally through achieving a level of immersion. Unfinished parts of the project at this stage include basic expansion of the testing area, implementing more answer slots, implementing test questions, and separating practice quizzes into different levels, whether that be through UI or a more primitive method of level design.

Code written relating to player movement and interaction were referenced through tutorials on YouTube. Scripts relating to level design and UI were largely created independently. Citations to outside sources are currently linked in each file where relevant, and are pending compilation into a single markdown file for ease of access. 

In all, the objective of what I am doing is creating a series of tests in a virtual environment to see if human memory is positively impacted compared to more traditional means of testing.
